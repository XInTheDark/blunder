Overview
--------

[Blunder](http://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?family=Blunder&print=Rating+list&print=Results+table&print=LOS+table&print=Ponder+hit+table&print=Eval+difference+table&print=Comopp+gamenum+table&print=Overlap+table&print=Score+with+common+opponents) is an open-source UCI compatible chess engine. The philosophy behind Blunder's design is for the code to 
be straightforward and easy to read, so that others can benefit from the project.

Installation
-----

Builds for Windows, Linux, and MacOS are included with each release of Blunder. However, if you
prefer to build Blunder from scratch the steps to do so are outlined below.

Visit [Golang download page](https://golang.org/dl/), and install Golang using the download
package appropriate for your machine. To make using the Golang compiler easier, make sure that if the installer asks,
you let it add the Golang compiler command to your path.

Your installation should be up and running in about 5-7 minutes, and from there, you need to open up a terminal/powershell/
command line, navigate to `blunder/blunder`, and run `go build`. This will create an executable for your computer, which you
should then able to run.

Alternatively, if the `make` build automation tool is installed on your computer (it comes standard on most Linux systems),
simply download this repository's zip file, unzip it, navigate to the primary folder, and run `make` from the command line.
An executable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS will be built and placed inside of the primary directory.

If you're on a windows platform, you'll need to run `make build-windows` instead.

Usage
-----

Blunder, like many chess engines, does not include its own GUI for chess playing, but supports something
known as the [UCI protocol](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html). This protocol allows chess engines, like Blunder, 
to communicate with different chess GUI programs.

So to use Blunder, it's reccomend you install one of these programs. Popular free ones include:

* [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
* [Scid](http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/)
* [Cute-chess](https://cutechess.com/) 

Once you have a program downloaded, you'll need to follow that specfic programs guide on how to install a chess engine. When prompted 
for a command or executable, direct the GUI to the Golang exectuable you built.
